# Game Solution :
To win the game you need to beat the master of the league. But first : 

## Talk to Professor Oak
He is located in the laboratory and will give you your first Pokémon : a Latios. He will also introduce you 
to the different zones of the game and what you can do there.

## Retrieve the Pokéball
You will find it in the water south of the playing area, and it is necessary for battling your rival Garry.

## Battle Garry
Garry is in your house; you need to interact with him to start the battle.

## Enter the Rolex League
In the Rolex are located four members of the Elite 4 which are represented by our teachers.
You need to defeat them all to be able to challenge the master of the league : Mrs. Jamila Sam here self.
They are dispatched around the spawn point (you can go through the green and blue walls).

## End of the game
The league master stands on the north-east corner of the map.
Once you have beaten here, you can go to the next semester and avoid MàN

## Sprites
We changed the sprites of the Prof.Oak and Garry and added the following


# WARNING #
Point modified compared to the instructions : it is not enough for the player to have a contact interaction with a Pokémon
to start a battle ; you need to interact with the L button. This choice was made to align with the original Pokémon 
game's functionality. 
Additionally, since the display of Pokémon was initially reversed in the prototype, we took the liberty of modifying
it so that the player's Pokémon is displayed on its side.
