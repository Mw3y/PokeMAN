## 🧩 Game Solution:
You spawn in your house, and you have to explore the map, speak to the different characters, and end by fighting the master of the Rolex League. In order to do that you must:

## 💬 Talk to Professor Oak
He is located in the laboratory and will give you your first Pokémon: a Latios. He will also introduce you to the different zones of the game and what you can do there.

## 🔍 Retrieve the Pokéball
You will find it in the water south of the playing area, and it is necessary for battling your rival Garry.

## ⚔️ Battle Garry
Garry is in your house; you need to interact with him to start the battle.

## 🏰 Enter the Rolex League
In the Rolex are located four members of the Elite 4 which are represented by our teachers. You need to defeat them all to be able to challenge the master of the league: Mrs. Jamila Sam herself. They are dispatched around the spawn point (you can go through the green and blue walls).

- Fight music.
- Sound effects when: Pokémon attacks, dialogs are passed, actions are selected in fights, a fight is finished,
  the player obtains a new Pokémon.
- (All fair use for scholarship purpose)

## 🎨 Sprites
New sprites :
- Different sprites for Prof. Oak and Garry.
- Sprinting sprite sheet for the player.
- A nurse sprite in the Lab.
- Sprites for our professors (the league members).
- 493 new Pokémon sprites.
- New maps sprites for the Rolex inside.

## ⚠️ WARNING
Point modified compared to the instructions: it is not enough for the player to have a contact interaction with a Pokémon
to start a battle; you need to interact with the L button. This choice was made to align with the original Pokémon
game's functionality.
Additionally, since the display of Pokémon was initially reversed in the prototype, we took the liberty of modifying
it so that the player's Pokémon is displayed on its side.
