# WARNING #
Point modified compared to the statement: it is not enough for the player to have a contact interaction with a Pokémon
to start a battle; they need to interact with the L button. This choice was made to align with the original Pokémon 
game's functionality. 
Additionally, since the display of Pokémon was initially reversed in the prototype, we took the liberty of modifying
it so that the player's Pokémon is displayed on their side
